Admitted Flaws with the Chain adder Version 1.
The chains are really brittle, if I had more time to reprint them I would
try to redesign them to be less brittle. It is really hard though
because of the size constraint I wanted. I wanted them to be small.

My project is really cool.
Used alot of solid works features.
took a unique theoretical idea and brung it to life.
:) pls give me an A.
